# python-api-challenge
 week 6 
Inside WeatherPy folder, you'll find
1. WeatherPy.ipynb
2. VacationPy.ipynb
    Which are the notebooks for the 2 parts of the assignment.
    WeatherPy.ipynb also contains the analysis observation for each of the linear regression pairs.
3. output_data folder
    Which contains the output from the notebooks, namely
    i. Fig 1 to 4 are the graph printout from WeatherPy.ipynb
    ii. cities.csv contains the city names and weather info generated by WeatherPy.ipynb, which is used in VacationPy.ipynb
    iii. city_hotels.csv contains the city name as well as hotel found in VacationPy.ipynb, because the API took a long time to finish running, so I thought I would save an output as file.
